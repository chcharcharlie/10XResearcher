# Phase D1: Hypotheses

Based on our initial discussion and preliminary knowledge, we have formulated the following hypotheses to guide our research:

## Market Growth Hypotheses
1. The renewable energy market will continue to grow at a CAGR of >7% for the next decade.
2. Solar PV will maintain the highest growth rate among established technologies.
3. APAC will remain the largest regional market, with North America showing accelerated growth.
4. Energy storage deployments will grow faster than renewable generation capacity.
5. The market is transitioning from policy-dependent to market-driven growth in mature markets.

## Subsector Performance Hypotheses
1. Utility-scale solar offers the best combination of growth and stability for investors.
2. Offshore wind will outpace onshore wind in growth rate but with higher volatility.
3. Hydropower will show the lowest growth but highest stability among major subsectors.
4. Energy storage will offer the highest growth potential but with significant technology risk.
5. Green hydrogen represents the highest risk/reward opportunity in the medium term.

## Investment Trend Hypotheses
1. VC investment is shifting from generation technologies to enabling technologies and software.
2. Public market renewable energy stocks are undervalued relative to growth prospects.
3. Traditional energy companies with strong renewable pivots will outperform pure-play renewable companies.
4. Corporate PPAs will become a major driver of renewable deployment, reducing policy dependence.
5. Institutional investors are systematically increasing renewable exposure across portfolios.

## Technology Development Hypotheses
1. Next-generation solar technologies (perovskite, tandem cells) will begin commercial deployment within 3 years.
2. Long-duration energy storage will reach commercial viability within 5 years.
3. Grid integration challenges represent the primary bottleneck to faster renewable adoption.
4. Green hydrogen will reach cost parity with gray hydrogen in selected markets within 5 years.
5. Software and AI will drive significant efficiency improvements in existing renewable assets.

## Policy Impact Hypotheses
1. Carbon pricing mechanisms will become more widespread and impactful on investment returns.
2. Subsidy phase-outs in mature markets will have limited negative impact due to cost declines.
3. Permitting and regulatory barriers, not economics, are the primary limitation to growth in developed markets.
4. Policy stability varies significantly by region, affecting risk profiles for long-term investments.
5. Emerging markets with strong policy frameworks will see the fastest growth in percentage terms.

## Risk Factor Hypotheses
1. Supply chain concentration presents a significant risk to solar PV growth projections.
2. Raw material constraints will impact battery storage deployment more than previously expected.
3. Grid integration costs are systematically underestimated in growth projections.
4. Technological disruption risk is highest in the storage sector.
5. Policy reversal risk varies significantly by region and subsector.

These hypotheses will be tested and refined through our research process. The findings will confirm, refute, or modify these initial assumptions.
